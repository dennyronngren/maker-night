# Aruco Marker application / library

This folder contains the Aruco marker computer vision (CV) project which aims to have functionality for navigate
our office robot (will it be named Toobot?) around the office. 

The produced output here is a binary that can be deployed on a Linux based Raspberry PI.

The current state of the code is that it runs OpenCV and shows images on the screen, the next step is to 
add the Aruco marker functionality.

# Setup
You need to install OpenCV binaries in c:\OpenCV <-- _PLEASE NOTE_ . Downloads are to be found here https://opencv.org/releases/

You need to do this before you build in VS.
